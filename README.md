For this project I used mangoDB for database. 
Also installing nodemon is a good thing to do.
I also used Postman to do requests

First of all I created a Shema which is an object with characteristics. (plank.js)
Then, in order to use this object, I linked the file to to main file which is index.js.
After that adding the libraries plugins and imports, I created the requests to handle
the object (get, post, put...).
Finaly, liked to the database of mangoDB.
